# Web 3 Revenue Primitives

<img src='imgs/coins.png'>

*Core primitives* are a set of concepts that are innately understood but cannot be expressed in simpler terms.

This repository is an attempt at list of *web3 revenue primitives*, created by, for, and at [ETHMagicians Prague 2018 by the business models ring](https://hackmd.io/DaJhrasLQteUk3IwX5bQAg?view#8-Business-Models-Ring).

[Notes from Business Models Ring at Eth Magicians, the first session which convened on 2018/10/29, are here](https://hackmd.io/W11KX6Y9R3idXXhN2tHFzA).

## Streaming Money

### Side Channels:
A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain(mainchain) using a two-way peg. You can move assets to the sidechain and then back to the parent chain.
Sidechains need their own miners. These miners can be incentivized through ‘merged mining’, whereby two separate cryptocurrencies, based on the same algorithm, are mined simultaneously.
Here is a list of some of the Sidechain Projects:

* [Plasma](http://plasma.io/)
* [Loom](https://loomx.io/)
* [POA](https://poa.network/)
* [Truebit](https://truebit.io/)

### State Channels:
State channels are basically two-way pathways opened between two users that want to communicate with each other in the form of transactions. Here, only the final outcome needs to be included in the form of one single transaction on main chain. Other transaction's are done on off chain. Few know projects around it are:

* [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/)
* [Machinomy](https://machinomy.com/)
* [FunFair](https://funfair.io/)
* [Liquidity](https://liquidity.network/)
* [Trinity](https://trinity.tech/#/)
* [Celer](https://www.celer.network/)
* [Spankchain](https://spankchain.com/)
* [Connext](https://connext.network/)
* [Counterfactual](https://counterfactual.com/)

## Non Fungible Tokens

Non fungible tokens are tokens that are unique from one another

Famous NFT projects:

* [CryptoKitties](https://medium.com/@codetractio/a-look-into-cryptokitties-revenue-model-6466b705a998)
* [OpenSea NFT marketplace](http://opensea.io)

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a recurring exchange of value over time.

* [EIP 1337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1337)
* [1337 Alliance](https://1337alliance.com)

## Self-Sovereign Identity

Identity Standards Proposals:
* [EIP 725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725)
* [EIP 725 Alliance](https://erc725alliance.org/)
* [EIP 1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) and [ERC 780](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)
* [Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/)
* [Decentralized Identifiers (DID)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/)

* [uPort](https://uport.me)
* [Civic](https://www.civic.com/)
* [BloomID](https://bloom.co/identity/)
* [TENZ-ID](https://tenzorum.org/tenz_id/)
* [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains)

## Lending

Smart contracts that control credit scores, loan issuance, and interest payments will run on top of protocols like Ethereum. These debt contracts will be hashed into existence and generate hashflow for the lenders. This is a flow of hashflow above the base layer protocol.

* [Dharma Protocol](https://dharma.io/)
* [LoanScan](https://loanscan.io/)

## Curating

The job of a search engine like Google is to collect and curate data from the Internet. This is one of the most valuable curation projects in the world. The key with curation markets is to get all of the incentives aligned so that you can trust the underlying data. The term used in the industry is the Token Curated Registry.
It’s not just about creating a list. It’s about creating a list you can trust by incentivising curators to do the research for you.

* [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/)
* [Messari](https://messari.io/)

## Creating

The creation of new things on chains will have value. Selling them to people who want them will generate hashflow. Making these unique tokens takes a lot of effort. You have to get a community of people to agree to their value.

* [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)

## Funding

Funding is the same whether it is at the ecosystem level or at the level of a single entity wanting to support funding. Grants are the main source of funding for projects in the Ethereum Community. Grants give a short time horizon for projects and don’t take into consideration the setup costs. Once a project has been set up, maintenance requires longer-term funding than grants provided. In many cases for an individual or small team, a business model of services can be considered on a project to project basis to find long term support. Operational costs hit projects with real-world budget and cash flow problems, and decentralized projects excel when they gather together for support. 

There is no one entity in charge of Ethereum, so the community must look at different funding bodies and revenue streams. For decentralized projects, it is a good idea to have different funding for different aspects of the ecosystem, such as stack, research, or community.  Obtaining multiple entities to fund a project is part of the shared ecosystem of Ethereum. Multiple entities of funding stop the community from defunding project Y, and instead disperse funding to both project X and Y. To get funding and sustainability of a project, it is best to collaborate with others who want to support the infrastructure, rather than waste time on putting together grant systems.

## Advertising

There are some options for doing advertising-based business models for open source projects, listed below.

## Personal Tokens
Personal tokens are fixed-supply and -cost ERC20 tokens that derive their value from the performance of a human being. They are commonly used to tokenize either individual service offerings or a fixed-price hourly service.

* [DAppBoi](https://dappboi.com/)

  DAppBoi is an example of a personal token which tokenizes an hour of digital work by designer Matthew Vernon. By initiating the ERC20 token with a fixed supply of 100 $BOI tokens, purchasable directly from Matthew for 0.65ETH each, this personal token allows an individual to effectively purchase, trade, and invest in Matthew's design skillset.

  The tokens are redeemed by sending them to Matthew, who in exchange for 1 $BOI token provides 1 hour of design work. By using a personal token, not only does Matthew create demand for his skillset through a fixed token supply, but he also ensures that he will receive a minimum of 0.65ETH for each hour he works, since he is the primary supplier of the token and hence, regulates its price. In addition, using a personal token ensures that even if the market price for $BOI falls, Matthew will have already been compensated at his pre-determined hourly rate for the tokens in circulation.

  In the case that Matthew denies service to an individual who redeems $BOI, although the market valuation for the token may fall, Matthew has already been paid in advance for the initial purchase, thus, fulfilling his hourly rate.

##Stablecoins Business Models

The main component behind stablecoins capturing value in a market is seigniorage. This is profit made by issuing currency, which is generated from the difference of the face value of the currency and its production costs. The three major types of stablecoins are:

* Fiat-backed
* Crypto-backed
* Algorithmic

###Fiat-Backed

A fiat-backed stablecoin system will collateralize every stablecoin issued with fiat currency or some other non-crypto asset. The fiat currency is stored with some custodian, such as a bank or major institution. 

These stable coins can generate revenue from collecting fees on issuing/redeeming stablecoins, market-making, or short-term lending. The most popular fiat stablecoin systems today are:
* [Tether](https://tether.to/)
* [TrueUSD](https://www.trusttoken.com/trueusd/)

###Crypto-Backed

Crypto-backed systems provide decentralized ways to maintain claims on collateral. Reserves of collateral are kept in the form of crypto-assets (such as ETH) on smart contracts. All issued stablecoins are backed by these reserves of ‘volatility coin’ collateral.

Crypto-backed stablecoin systems focus more on the volatility coin put up as collateral to generate revenue. These systems can collect transaction fees created on-chain. Holders of the volatility coin are then paid proportionally.
In the case of Maker, they issue stablecoins as collateralized debt positions, which accumulate interest at an annual rate of 2.5%. The interest is again paid proportionally to those holding on the volatility coin. Other crypto-backed stablecoins have issued shares for collateral assets, which can be redeemed in exchange for stablecoins or another asset. Check out:
* [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/)
* [Havven](https://www.synthetix.io/)

###Algorithmic

A newer business model, algorithmic stablecoins adjust supply to stabilize price without collateral requirements. These stablecoins may use a volatility coin to capitalize the system at first. This system is very lucrative due to the fact that all supply increases in the stablecoin are distributed to those holding on to the volatility coin.

These stablecoin systems can issue shares called seigniorage shares. When there is demand for more stablecoins, more are issued to offset demand and keep price level. If demand decreases and price of stablecoins fall, shares are put up for sale in exchange for stablecoins, which are then burnt from supply. Therefore, if the market cap of stable coins reaches a certain level, the value of all seigniorage shares will be at that same level.

Another revenue-generating tactic are variable interest rate deposits, where users can deposit stablecoins into smart contracts that pay out interest. When demand is low, interest rates are increased to incentivize depositing stablecoins, which lowers the circulating supply of stablecoins and price increases; and vice-versa.
