# Web 3 Revenue Primitives

<img src='imgs/coins.png'>

*Core primitives* are a set of concepts that are innately understood but cannot be expressed in simpler terms.

This repository is an attempt at list of *web3 revenue primitives*, created by, for, and at [ETHMagicians Prague 2018 by the business models ring](https://hackmd.io/DaJhrasLQteUk3IwX5bQAg?view#8-Business-Models-Ring).

## Marketplace Percentage Fee

This model is where you take a % of each trsanction on your platform.  It is popular with exchanges.

## ICOS

Sell a bunch of ERC20 tokens at once, or during a window of time.

Some popular ICO models:

* [Security Token Offerings](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/security-tokens/)
* [Interactive ICO](https://medium.com/legal-block/interactive-coin-offering-a-token-distribution-alternative-model-or-the-new-face-of-the-ipos-61eee71e75ef)
* [Initial Supply Auction](https://medium.com/@MetronomeToken/metronomes-initial-supply-auction-quick-glance-price-chart-c9132595871e)
* [Simple Agreement for Future Tokens](https://medium.com/@argongroup/explaining-the-simple-agreement-for-future-tokens-framework-15d5e7543323)
* [Cryptocurrency Airdrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airdrop_(cryptocurrency))

TODO -- Fill in subcategories: security token, utility token, etc.

## Continous Funding Models

Sell a bunch of ERC20 tokens *over time*.

* [Continuous Organizations](https://medium.com/@thibauld/introducing-continuous-organizations-22ad9d1f63b7?_branch_match_id=578515516036471346)
* [Curved Bonding](https://medium.com/@simondlr/tokens-2-0-curved-token-bonding-in-curation-markets-1764a2e0bee5)

## Streaming Money 

### Plasma:
 Plasma is a proposed framework for incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts which is scalable to a significant amount of state updates per second (potentially billions) enabling the blockchain to be able to represent a significant amount of decentralized financial applications worldwide. These smart contracts are incentivized to continue operation autonomously via network transaction fees, which is ultimately reliant upon the underlying blockchain. Some, know projects are:
 * [Truebit](https://truebit.io/)
 * [Plasma](http://plasma.io/plasma.pdf)
 
### State Channels:
State channels are basically two-way pathways opened between two users that want to communicate with each other in the form of transactions. Here, only the final outcome needs to be included in the form of one single transaction on main chain. Other transaction's are done on off chain. Few know projects around it are:

* [Spankchain](https://spankchain.com/)
* [Connext](https://connext.network/)
* [Counterfactual](https://counterfactual.com/)


## Non Fungible Tokens

Non fungible tokens are tokens that are unique from one another

Famous NFT projects:

* [CryptoKitties](https://medium.com/@codetractio/a-look-into-cryptokitties-revenue-model-6466b705a998)
* [OpenSea NFT marketplace](http://opensea.io)

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a recurring exchange of value over time.

* [EIP 1337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1337)
* [1337 Alliance](https://1337alliance.com)

## Questionable / Possible Ponzi Schemes

TODO - What else should live here? 

* [Fomo3d](https://medium.com/@eetusro/i-note-this-is-fin-e-6646f4a1e55b)

### Rent

* [Determining a fair rent model of ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/determining-a-fair-rent-model/603) = NOTE: At ENS, the purpose of the rent is to avoid squatters rather than making profit
