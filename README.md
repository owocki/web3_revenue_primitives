# Web 3 Revenue Primitives

<img src='imgs/coins.png'>

*Core primitives* are a set of concepts that are innately understood but cannot be expressed in simpler terms.

This repository is an attempt at list of *web3 revenue primitives*, created by, for, and at [ETHMagicians Prague 2018 by the business models ring](https://hackmd.io/DaJhrasLQteUk3IwX5bQAg?view#8-Business-Models-Ring). 

[Notes from Business Models Ring at Eth Magicians, the first session which convened on 2018/10/29, are here](https://hackmd.io/W11KX6Y9R3idXXhN2tHFzA).

## Marketplace Percentage Fee

This model is where you take a % of each trsanction on your platform.  It is popular with exchanges.

## ICOS

Sell a bunch of ERC20 tokens at once, or during a window of time.

## Streaming Money

### Side Channels:
A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain(mainchain) using a two-way peg. You can move assets to the sidechain and then back to the parent chain.
Sidechains need their own miners. These miners can be incentivized through ‘merged mining’, whereby two separate cryptocurrencies, based on the same algorithm, are mined simultaneously.
Here is a list of some of the Sidechain Projects:

* [Plasma](http://plasma.io/)
* [Loom](https://loomx.io/)
* [POA](https://poa.network/)
* [Truebit](https://truebit.io/)
 
### State Channels:
State channels are basically two-way pathways opened between two users that want to communicate with each other in the form of transactions. Here, only the final outcome needs to be included in the form of one single transaction on main chain. Other transaction's are done on off chain. Few know projects around it are:

* [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/)
* [Machinomy](https://machinomy.com/)
* [FunFair](https://funfair.io/)
* [Liquidity](https://liquidity.network/)
* [Trinity](https://trinity.tech/#/)
* [Celer](https://www.celer.network/)
* [Spankchain](https://spankchain.com/)
* [Connext](https://connext.network/)
* [Counterfactual](https://counterfactual.com/)

## Non Fungible Tokens

Non fungible tokens are tokens that are unique from one another

Famous NFT projects:

* [CryptoKitties](https://medium.com/@codetractio/a-look-into-cryptokitties-revenue-model-6466b705a998)
* [OpenSea NFT marketplace](http://opensea.io)

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a recurring exchange of value over time.

* [EIP 1337](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1337)
* [1337 Alliance](https://1337alliance.com)

## Questionable / Possible Ponzi Schemes

TODO - What else should live here? 

* [Fomo3d](https://medium.com/@eetusro/i-note-this-is-fin-e-6646f4a1e55b)

### Rent

* [Determining a fair rent model of ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/determining-a-fair-rent-model/603) = NOTE: At ENS, the purpose of the rent is to avoid squatters rather than making profit
